Hi, my name is Leonardo Marini, let me tell you a bit of myself:
I graduared at University of Bologna as Doctor in Computer Science Engineering, and I'm currently doing a Master to specilize in Visualization and Interactive Graphics.
I was born in Italy in 1997 and I consider myself to be an hybrid between a **developer** and an **artist**.
Here you will find some of my works related to either of these subjetcs or, more likely, a combination of them.

I like fitness, dogs and 3D art.

Drop me a line at any of my socials (links in the upper left corner) or to my email (see the footer).
