## Modeling and Animation
My focus in the beginning of the project was on learning **character animation**, this unfortunatly didn't end up being used in the final version as we decided to switch our 
approach to using a **simple head** as the character instead of a fullbody model. After this switch, I created the initial head model with **blendshapes** along with the interface 
used to **animate** them.
