My primary contributions during the first half of the project were the implementation of the **grid system** through which the enviroment operates, including 
**positioning and collision** rules for props and walls within the grid, as well as **pathfinding**. At a later point, I also implemented a set of **interactions**
which allows the user to **edit the environment** by adding, removing and moving props around. During the second half of the project, I focused mostly on creating 
**3D models, textures and interactions** for environmental props and structures.
