## Multiplayer programmer and Web developer
At the start of the project I fucesed mostly on the **design of the software**: defining classes and distributing the work across the team. During the development 
of VDungeon I implemented the **networking** features that allow multiple player to connect together and **interact** with each other, sharing the same environment.
Part of my time was also spent into the design of some of **graphics**, such as different **characters**, that didn't made to the current version of the project.
