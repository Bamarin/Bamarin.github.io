## Face tracking and Dice system developer

My main contribution to the project is the implementation of the **face tracking system** and building the **mapping** between face tracking data and the 3D model. I also 
build the **server-client connection between Python and Unity** in order to communicate data from face tracking in Python to Unity. During the later stage of the project, 
I focus on implementing Kalman filter and Median filter to **reduce noise in image processing** and **stabilize the model animation**. And I created a **dice system** with 
crafted **model** and smooth **rolling interaction**, which is a typical game mechanic in a tabletop game.
