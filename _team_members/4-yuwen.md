In the early stage of this project, I mainly contributed to the control of the game, including the handle of **multiple and dynamic cameras**, drag-and-move control on the game board, as well as the **first person control** on both PC and mobile devices through **gyroscope or swiping**. In the later stage of the project, I focused more on the **UI design and implementation**, including the set-up of the **main menu scene**, the connection to the network manager, and the **UI animation** throughout the game. I also implemented the **particle effects** for fire and included simple **global illumination**.
