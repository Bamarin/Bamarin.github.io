### Lessons Learned

    Perhaps one of the most important lessons that were learned during this project was knowing when to scale back - deciding to use simplistic face models rather than complex and realistic rigs was a good decision in the end. While I would still have liked to see complex face animations eventually, it was important that we got the basics done first if we were to go further with it.

    <blockquote>
    One lesson that I learned throughout the project is the importance of cooperation and communication among team members, especially in this social distancing situation. At the first stage of the project, due to not fully understanding the task assignments, I repeatedly did the task for generation of grids. While at the later stage, due to better cooperation, problems such as the ones met when merging branches were solved more smoothly.
